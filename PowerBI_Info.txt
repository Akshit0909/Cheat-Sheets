==REGIONAL SETTINGS

Several of the csv files used in this section contain date fields, which follow US-specific formatting (MM/DD/YYYY).
If you are located outside of the United States your system may not recognize these fields as dates, and they may be 
loaded as text fields instead (which yields errors and prevents you from using the Date & Time tools in the Query Editor).

Note that regional settings may impact other fields as well, including currency, since some regions use a comma as a 
decimal separator ($2,75) instead of a period ($2.75). Furthermore, some regional settings require a semicolon (;) to 
separate lists or formula arguments, rather than a comma (,) as shown in the course.

If you are using non-US regional settings, please follow the steps below:

Option 1) Update Power BI Desktop Regional Settings
1. Open Power BI Desktop and click the File menu
2. Navigate down the menu options and select Options and Settings, then, select Options from the sub menu
3. From the Options window, click on Regional Settings located under the Current File options
4. Update the Locale for Import to English (United States)
5. Click OK, save the workbook, and close and reopen to confirm that the settings have been applied

Note: This process updates the regional settings for the current Power BI workbook only. 
If you open a new Power BI workbook and need to update the regional settings, you'll need to repeat this same process.



Option 2) Update Windows Regional Settings
Microsoft Windows regional settings will influence how your date/time, numeric, and currency data types appear when 
you apply formatting options. The following procedure shows you how to change the Windows regional settings for your computer:

Windows 10

1. Click the Start button, and then click Control Panel
2. Click Change date, time, or number formats
The Region dialog box appears
3. On the Formats tab, select the format you want to change from the drop-down list. Now click the Additional Settings button
The Customize Format dialog box appears
4. Click the tab that contains the settings that you want to modify and make your changes. For example, to change part or all of a number format, click the Numbers tab and change the setting that you want

==ROLLING CALENDER : From a date to current date (dynamic)

= List.Dates(Source, Number.From(DateTime.LocalNow()) - Number.From(Source), #duration(1,0,0,0))

Source is manually entered date : =#(2018,1,1)
What we're doing: 
-Calculate the current date and compare that to the source date (this subtraction will result in a number)
-Based on a difference between those 2 dates, list down all of individual values where duration is one day

Give me a list at daily granularity between the source date and current date

== TRANSPOSE VS PIVOT

Pivot : Vertical to Horizantal : In case of duplicate values it will consider them as one and sum them up
Transpose : If we have duplicate values, it will consider them as different

======================================================================================================================
==REFRESH SETTINGS

When we click on refresh, it will refresh all the files. What if I don't want to refresh certain files(as it takes time and those
are lookup files that don't really change much)

Go to transform data(query editor) -> Right click data on left pane -> Uncheck "Include in refresh"	

======================================================================================================================
Statistics tools are only available to use from the Transform tab in the Query Editor
Latest returns a single value (like Statistical functions), and can only be accessed from the "Transform" tab
Unpivoting transforms a table from a horizontal orientation to a vertical orientation by turning distinct column values into rows
