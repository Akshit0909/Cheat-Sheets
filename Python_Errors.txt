PYTHON ERROR:

Appending DataFrames

ValueError: Plan shapes are not aligned
Reason: When two columns have same names, Pandas get confused which one to join to which one
Solution:
this was caused when I tried to concat dataframe df1 with columns ['A', 'B', 'B', 'C'] 
(see the duplicate column headings?) with dataframe df2 with columns ['A', 'B']. 
Understandably the duplication caused pandas to throw a wobbly. 
Change df1 to ['A', 'B', 'C'] (i.e. drop one of the duplicate columns) and everything works fine.
