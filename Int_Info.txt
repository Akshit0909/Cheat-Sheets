2. Unsampling Binary Classification. How to deal with imbalance classes with unsampling in Python
Data was a dataframe like feature_0 feature_1 .... target
target had value 0,1

3. Downsampling Binary Classification
4. Calculate f1_score. I was given actual and predicted list which both had values in shape like [0,1,0..]
5. Convert numpy array date to datetimestamp. Output was like [timestamp(1990-08-93 12:12:12),...]
6. Strip punctuation from string. String module was imported
7. Delete rows where a column is more than a threshold value
8. What is the output
9. Calculate minimum value in a numpy matrix


def foo(*args):
    print('foo(',*args,')')
    
    def inside_foo(x):
        print('inside_foo')
        
        def inside_inside_foo(*args):
            print('inside_inside_foo(',*args,')')
            return x(*args)
        
        return inside_inside_foo
    return inside_foo


@foo(1,2,3)
def bar(*args):
    return sum(args)


print('outside')
print(bar(4,5,6))

STATS

1. We have to see how 2 variables vary according to a category with more than 10 entities. Use ANOVA/MANOVA etc
2. Stratified/Clustered/Bootstrap sampling
3. Which sampling to use in '=
4. How does r squared and correlation related in univariate and multivariate?
Does r square means squared of correlation in only univariate or in both?
5. Sampling method for blood pressure hypertension
6. Sampling method for : First take 5% sample in each category then take random sample : cluster/multistage/stratified/simple random?
7. if probability of one event is 1.001 time probability of another and there is 0.25% probability that it happened by chance
then what is it is the association important/unimportant and statisctically significant/ not ss
8. if 95% confidence interval in t test includes 0 is it statisctically significan or what
9. Calculate variance. 5 sample size. 20 population mean. sum of squared = 2100
